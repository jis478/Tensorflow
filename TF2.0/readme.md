# Tensorflow 2.0 

Tensorflow 2.0 style implementations for various GAN Research papers 
(Framework: Tensorflow 1.13 + Keras API + Eager mode)

  - CycleGAN (completed) : New implementation based on the paper
  - StarGAN (completed) : New implementation based on the paper
  - SinGAN (completed) : Converted from the original Pytorch code (all the Pytorch funtions coverted to the corresponding TF ones)
  - ProgressiveGAN (still working on this but hard to implement)
